    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><br></p><p>The wolf, wandering through the forest, was thinking about the question that had been bothering him for the past few weeks. He'd been wandering, looking for the answer for ages, barely eating a thing because his mind was too preoccupied to hunt, eat or even sleep. Living of the occasional dead mouse he found, he grew skinny and weary.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">One day however, while he was pondering on giving up on it all, he felt the unsettling feeling of someone watching him. The feeling was so intense that, even in his awful condition, he seemed to take notice of it.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>He searched for the source of the experience and found it right behind him on a branch high up in an ancient ash. The great black raven had been sitting there for a very long time. So long, that it appeared as though he had always been there. He seemed old and shabby, a white gleam over its eyes suggesting it was going blind with age. He saw sufficiently to watch the troubled wolf though and he saw his chance.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The wolf looked up at him, noticing his presence, but only in the slightest. The raven stretched out his wings, ruffling his feathers, and spoke. He spoke in the typical monotone, deep manner with which ravens generally speak : “You are troubled, wolf. You have questions, I have answers.”. This caught the attention of the wolf. He felt a sparkle of hope, could it be that the ancient raven before him was wise enough to answer his question?&nbsp;</p><p>Th bird noticed his interest and continued to speak. (Even for his kind, the bird knew an awful lot of words). “Everything has a price, and so has the answer you are so desperately seeking. I know the question, do you know the price?” The wolf didn't know, but he'd gladly have given anything he had for this torture to stop. Not being able to speak, he nodded is head saying he was ready and willing.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The sign was barely enough for the raven to see, but he assumed the answer and came flying down to match the height of the wolf. “Then I will take your sight, which was also taken from me.”. He hopped even closer to the wolf, assured by the fact that by not having answered his question yet, the wolf would be harmless. There was an uneasy tension between the two creatures, when at last the wolf's sight began to dwindle. The raven took just enough to restore his own, leaving the poor wolf with the ability to see shapes and light, but not a lot more. He bowed his head in acceptance and gratitude.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>And so the raven, being an honest creature by nature, made to answer the question. And the wolf listened carefully.&nbsp;</p><p>“The question you have is a complicated one, and I am not sure if you will accept the answer as the truth.”. The wolf felt a growing unease. Had he really expected a simple answer? Fear struck him as he realized he would either not understand the answer that would be given to him or he would not like, nor accept it.&nbsp;</p><p>In his fear there was a terrible power. A power that had been dormant for so long now found its way out with a thunderous roar.&nbsp;</p><p>The raven, not expecting this turn of events,  was too late to realize what had happened in the wolf's mind and fell victim to the agonizing fear. He managed to scratch an eye out, but the wolf didn't feel any external pain and killed the raven in a single bite. Upon tasting the birds blood the wolf regained the control over himself. It took him some time, standing with the dead raven in his mouth, before it dawned upon him that he had killed the only way out of his situation. Not only has he lost the chance for an answer, but he had also lost his sight. Worse even, he felt even more lost and lonely than before meeting the raven.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually he set of once more to travel in the woods, forever looking for answers he'd never find.&nbsp;</p></div>
